A bit about myself:
My name is Pim van Hees. I'm 23 years old and am currently enrolled in the masters program Mechanical Engineering of the Eindhoven University of Technology. At the moment I am following the subject Scientific Computation by Joris Remmers and Cleemens Verhoossel which teaches students about coding professionally.
